# 🚀 DSA & Problem Solving Journey

This repository documents my journey of learning **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **Problem Solving (PS)** in depth, with the goal of building a strong Computer Science foundation and preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Master each **Data Structure** and **Algorithm** (understanding internals and trade-offs, not just usage).
- Solve a wide range of problems to strengthen **problem-solving skills**.
- Build **implementations from scratch** for all DS/Algo.
- Develop **mini-projects** to demonstrate real-world applications.
- Create a **personal reference** that I (and others) can revisit later.
